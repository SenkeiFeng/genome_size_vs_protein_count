# Genome size vs. protein count

A Shiny app that plots an up-to-date version of the total number of annotated proteins
in genomes submitted to GenBank as a function of genome size (based on data provided by
[NCBI genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome) reports). The app stays up-to-date by
retrieving data from the [NCBI FTP server](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GENOME_REPORTS)
upon loading.

is a frozen version of one created by this app (using the Download SVG button).

## Notes

Commits to branches are automatically deployed to shiny via a
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/smsaladi/genome_size_vs_protein_count) build.
